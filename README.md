# Clusterize - helper for core cluster module

Clusterize is a small helper module which wraps the [cluster module](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.0/api/cluster.html) offered by Node 0.6.x.

## Install
	
	$ npm install clusterize

## Usage

	// server.js

	var clusterize = require('clusterize'),
		http = require('http');

	var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
		res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
		res.end('Hello Clusterize!');
	});

	clusterize(server, 5100, {numWorkers: 4});

You can then start the server normally

	$ node server.js

## API

###clusterize(httpServer, port, [options]);

**`options`**:

* `numWorkers` : number of workers to fork, defaults to the number of available cores

## Using with Express 2.x

To use Clusterize with your Express application, simply export your `app` object and pass it to Clusterize

	// app.js
	var app = express.createServer();
	app.configure(function() {
		// ...
	});

	module.exports = app;

	// server.js

	var clusterize = require('clusterize'),    
    	app = require('./app');

	clusterize(app, 3000, {numWorkers: 2});

Start your app this way

	$ node server.js

## TODO

This is pretty much a work in progress:

	* Tests
	* Starting, stopping, and restarting the cluster from command line
	* Sending messages to peers
	* Generate PID files for master and workers
	* Send email with stack trace when worker crashes
